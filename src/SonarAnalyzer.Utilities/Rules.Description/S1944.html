<p>
    Inappropriate casts are issues that will lead to unexpected behavior or runtime errors, such as
    <code>InvalidCastException</code>s. The compiler will catch bad casts from one class to another, but not bad casts to
    interfaces. Also, nullable values that are known to be empty can't be cast to their underlying value type.
</p>

<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
public interface MyInterface
{ /* ... */ }

public class Implementer : MyInterface
{ /* ... */ }

public class MyClass
{ /* ... */ }

public static class Program
{
  public static void Main()
  {
    var myclass = new MyClass();
    var x = (MyInterface) myclass; // Noncompliant, InvalidCastException is being thrown
    var b = myclass is MyInterface; // Noncompliant, always false

    int? i = null;
    var ii = (int)i; // Noncompliant, InvalidOperationException is being thrown
  }
}
</pre>

<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>
    No issue is reported if the interface has no implementing class in the assembly.
