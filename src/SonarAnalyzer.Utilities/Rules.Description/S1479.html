<p>
  When <code>switch</code> statements have a large set of <code>case</code> clauses, it is usually an attempt to map two sets of data. A real map structure would be more readable and maintainable, and should be used instead.

<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>
    No issue is reported on <code>switch</code> statements that work on <code>enum</code>s.
