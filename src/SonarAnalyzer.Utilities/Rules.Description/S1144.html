<p>
    Private types or members that are never executed or referenced are dead code: unnecessary, inoperative code that
    should be removed. Cleaning out dead code decreases the size of the maintained codebase, making it easier to
    understand the program and preventing bugs from being introduced.

<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
public class Foo
{
  private void UnusedPrivateMethod() {...} // Noncompliant

  private class UnusedClass {...} // Noncompliant
}
</pre>

<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
public class Foo
{
  private Foo()
  {
    UsedPrivateMethod();
  }

  private void UsedPrivateMethod()
  {
    var c = new UsedClass();
  }

  private class UsedClass {...}
}
</pre>

<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>
    This rule doesn't raise any issue on empty constructors and attributed members.
